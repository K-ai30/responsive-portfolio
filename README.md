# Responsive Portfolio

CSS and Bootstrap

### Description

This project was created to design a more mobile-first portfolio site compared to the original portfolio site it was modeled after.  The challenges with this project were in adapting the formatting and customization through bootstrap elements rather than an external style sheet.  Ultimately, the benefits of using external style sheets (organization, specific targeting, and visibility) helped resolve issues regarding which elements were being impacted with each line of code.  The application also gives professionals a great way to display their projects and other professional materials.

### Notes

I started building this website to serve as my portfolio site to showcase my coding projects. However, this project could be adapted to provide a basic framework for any type of basic website.  To that end, I hope to achieve some future dated development ideas that will enhance the user engagement with the site.
