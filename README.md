# Responsive Portfolio

### Description

CSS and Bootstrap

This project was created using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 4 to design a mobile-first portfolio site.  I modeled this site after my original portfolio site.  The challenges with this project were in adapting the formatting and customization through bootstrap elements rather than an external style sheet.  Ultimately, the benefits of using external style sheets (organization, specific targeting, and visibility) helped resolve issues regarding which elements were being impacted with each line of code.

### Technologies Utilized:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap 4

### Features Included:

The visitor can access the following items:

- Home/About Page
- Portfolio Page
- Contact Page
- Mobile-friendly

One of the "extra" or additional features included were enhanced elements on the Navigation Links to add styling to the buttons in the form of "On Hover" effects.

### Notes

I started building this website to serve as my portfolio site to showcase my coding projects. However, this project could be adapted to provide a basic framework for any type of basic website.  To that end, I hope to achieve some future dated development ideas that will enhance the user engagement with the site.
