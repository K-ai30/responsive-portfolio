# Responsive Portfolio
CSS and Bootstrap


This project was created using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 4 to design a mobile-first portfolio site.  I modeled this site after my portfolio site.  The challenges with this project were in adapting the formatting and customization through bootstrap elements rather than an external style sheet.  Ultimately, the benefits of using external style sheets (prganization, specific targeting, and visibility) helped resolve issues regarding which elements were being impacted with each line of code.
