                    I am passionate about art, especially drawing, painting, photography and design.  I have a Bachelor of Fine Art in Photography from Savannah College of Art and Design.  After working for 5 years, I went back to school for my masters while working full-time.  I currently hold a Master of Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing.  Outside of my interests in continued learning, I volunteer and work with a couple of nonprofit organizations.

                    My favorite hobbies include working with digital platforms (Canva, Adobe Creative Suite, and Microsoft Office) and social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram).  Through social media, content creation and website updates, I often assist the nonprofit with whom I volunteer and whose mission I value.  I collaborated with the nonprofit and a team of graphic designers and web developers to overhaul and update their website.

                  <p class="p">
                    I have helped others interested in building their brand by creating a website and social media presence.  This work led to my interest in coding and web development.  When I am not at work or learning something new, I spend a great deal of time watching Marvel superhero movies (or Netflix and Hulu), reading science fiction/fiction novels, spending time with friends and family.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p">
                    Through the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp, I am working toward becoming a full stack web developer with the intent of focusing on front-end web development.  I want to become a web developer and learn skills that make me more competitive as a digital marketing professional.  In particular, I have enjoyed my exposure to coding languages and want to become more adept at understanding and using those languages, as it relates to web design and layout.
